excerpt: Systems Security Research Lab at UCL, combining program analysis and machine learning for systems security
---

The Systems Security Research Lab (S2Lab) sits in the [Information
Security Research Group](https://sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk) of the [Department of
Computer Science](https://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk) at [University College
London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk) (UCL). 

Our vision is to develop techniques to automatically protect systems
from vulnerabilities and malicious activities. (Certainly, a broad
remit. Let's scope it a bit.) How? We work at the intersection of
**program analysis** and **machine learning** for **systems security**.
Ah, the buzzwords. It may be tempting to believe we've been following
the Machine Learning-Cybersecurity hype: that's untrue, although a plausible
thought. 

IN FACT.

Looking back at how we started, it is possible to track our heritage 
to the underground hacker and academic security communities: 

* [Smashing the stack for fun and profit](http://phrack.org/issues/49/14.html), as one of the very first
attempts to discuss the details of low-level systems security through
the lens of the exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities; and

* [Intrustion Detection via Static Analysis](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw/papers/ids-oakland01.pdf),
as one of the very first attempts to combine (static) program analysis
with anomaly detection.

Since then, we've always been intrigued by the role these disciplines
play to secure our systems. The democratization of machine learning
approaches has clearly increased our appetite further to reason about
the intertwined relationship program analysis and machine learning have
for systems security in the presence of adversaries.

Ultimately, we aim to build practical tools and provide security
services to the community at large, while supporting [open
science](https://www.ukri.org/our-work/supporting-healthy-research-and-innovation-culture/open-research/)
at our best.

We are thankful to the several sponsors who have funded our research,
including [UKRI EPSRC](https://epsrc.ukri.org), EU,
GCHQ/[NCSC](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk), Intel Security, NVIDIA Corporation,
and [AVAST Software](https://www.avast.com). Moreover, we are unduly grateful to the many
collaborators whom we have been working with or have provided
cross-pollination opportunities (indirectly too) to influence, inspire,
and refine our research vision further.

_We aim at pursuing academic excellence while embracing disruptive thinking at its best._
