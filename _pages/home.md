excerpt: Systems Security Research Lab at UCL, combining program analysis and machine learning for systems security
---

The Systems Security Research Lab (S2Lab) sits in the [Information
Security Research Group](https://sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk) of the [Department of
Computer Science](https://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk) at [University College
London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk) (UCL). 

Our vision is to develop techniques that automatically protect systems
from vulnerabilities and malicious activities. Certainly, this is a broad
remit, so let's narrow the scope a bit. We work at the intersection of
**program analysis** and **machine learning** for **systems security**.
Ah, the buzzwords. It may be tempting to believe we're just following
the machine learning/cybersecurity hype, but that would be untrue.  

_In fact_ our motivation can be traced back to two particular research efforts 
from the underground hacker and academic security communities which touched 
on these topics: 

* [Smashing the stack for fun and profit](http://phrack.org/issues/49/14.html), one of the very first
attempts to discuss the details of low-level systems security through
the lens of the exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities; and
* [Intrusion Detection via Static Analysis](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw/papers/ids-oakland01.pdf), 
one of the very first attempts to combine (static) program analysis
with anomaly detection.

Since these works, we've always been intrigued by the role these disciplines
play to secure our systems. The democratization of machine learning
approaches has clearly increased our appetite further to reason about
how program analysis and machine learning can intertwine in order to improve
systems security in the presence of adversaries.

Ultimately, we aim to build practical tools and provide security
services to the community at large, while supporting [open
science](https://www.ukri.org/our-work/supporting-healthy-research-and-innovation-culture/open-research/). 

We are thankful to the several sponsors who have funded our research,
including [UKRI EPSRC](https://epsrc.ukri.org), EU,
GCHQ/[NCSC](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk), Intel Security, NVIDIA Corporation,
and [AVAST Software](https://www.avast.com). Moreover, we are eternally grateful to the many
collaborators whom we have been working with or have provided
opportunities for cross-pollination to influence, inspire,
and further refine our research vision.

_We are committed to pursuing academic excellence while embracing [disruptive thinking](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/play/live-tv/disruptive-thinking-tv) at its best._
