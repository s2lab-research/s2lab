Intimate knowledge of low-level details enables adversaries to infiltrate and abuse whole systems with ever more sophisticated attacks. 
As defenders it's integral that we can meet that knowledge with similar expertise to protect against them. 

By thinking like adversaries and performing our own **exploitation development**, we're able to stay one step ahead and develop
defences against new attacks before they're discovered and exploited by bad actors. 

On the other side of the same coin, new techniques in **vulnerability discovery** and analysis can prevent bugs and secure 
existing systems to mitigate potential attack vectors. 
To do so at a large scale, we can make use of automated techniques such as **program analysis** which allow for systematic, 
repeatable software assessments. 

As one of our core research streams, output from this area heavily informs our other efforts, providing a toolkit 
for a wide array of useful techniques such as code obfuscation, automated software transplantation, and binary analysis.
