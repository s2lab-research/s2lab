The use of **AI for security** has proven to be a promising avenue for many critical tasks such as intrusion detection and malware classification. 

Reducing manual effort, increasing response times, and generalising to new examples allows defenders to react 
quickly to incoming threats and allocate valuable human expertise more efficiently. 

However, the dynamic nature of data typically seen in security tasks, resulting from the ongoing arms race between attackers 
and defenders, causes issues that need to be addressed in order to use machine learning to its full potential. 
**Concept drift** occurs as malicious techniques evolve and previously trained models aren't equipped to handle them. 
The crafting of **adversarial examples** enables attackers to create specific inputs that bypass ML-based detectors. 
And many open questions regarding the **security of AI**, such as information leakage, covert backdoors, and data poisoning, continue to be researched. 

AI is a powerful if not revolutionary technology for society, but in reaping the rewards we must also guarantee its safety.
