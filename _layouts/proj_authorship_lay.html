    Attributing a piece of malware to its creator typically requires threat intelligence to attain a sufficient
    confidence level. Binary attribution increases the level of difficulty as it mostly relies upon the ability
    to disassemble binaries to gather relevant features and build a fingerprint to identify the author.
    <br/><br/>
    To date, most research focuses on source code authorship attribution and the application of similar techniques
    to benign and malicious binaries. However, this approach provides an opportunity for malicious authors to attack
    the authorship attribution models due to the stark differences between both source code and binaries and benign
    and malicious authors.
    <br/><br/>
    Our survey (joint work with <a href="https://s3lab.isg.rhul.ac.uk/aptclass">S3Lab</a>) explores the style of threat actors and the adversarial techniques used by them to remain anonymous.
    We examine the adversarial impact on state-of-the-art methods for binary authorship attribution. Through this
    approach, we identify key findings and explore the open research challenges to identifying authorship style within
    malicious binaries.
    <br/><br/>
    One major challenge is the lack of a ground truth dataset of malware and authors. To mitigate
    this issue for the community, <b>we publish alongside this survey a meta-information dataset of 15,660 malware
    labeled to 164 threat actor groups</b>. This is the largest and diverse dataset to date. Additionally, we identify a
    further 7,485 malicious samples currently linked to unknown groups.
